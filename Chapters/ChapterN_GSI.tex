STUDY 1: June 8th Gold coated wires




To do simulations with gaussian approximations for x and y axes and more realistic aproximation. plot of both given beam sizes and then plot of maximum temperature simulated in both cases. 



Compare that to the results of not even seing the gold evaporated. 



This are the measured profiles in study 2 as a function of intensity. As one can see from the picture \ref{fig:FancyStudy2Plot} for a constant beam pulse lenght of 40 us, increasing the intensity did not affect the measurements (Images on the top) however once the beam pulse lenght was increased up to 70 mu A, the wires broke very fast. 


This effect can also be observed in the projections of this plots. Figure \ref{fig:ProjectionOfStudy2}.
